# cybersecuritybase-project

This is the first course project for Cyber Security MOOC course series (https://cybersecuritybase.github.io/), 
organised by the University of Helsinki in collaboration with F-secure Ltd. Project is forked of a course template https://github.com/cybersecuritybase/cybersecuritybase-project.

My aim within this project was to implement a very simple web application with at least five common, severe security flaws.
Identified flaws are reported in another dokument; 'Five_of_ten_report.md'.

This software contains a webpage(html), an SQL-database and Java Spring application with JPA. All files are available by cloning/downloading this repository.

Backupstory:
ValentineHappiness is a modern cross-field Entrepreneurs Community (or could be). They have a lot of members, and they also offer them some benefits, like credit cards. Community has a tradition to keep yearly Valentine's Day -campaign, and this site is about the event.

Website user can register to the community or check if there are shops giving presents in their hometown. Admins can also login to the site and see more information of companies involved.
---------------

There is default admin-user you can use to explore the site:
name: admin
pwd: 1234

You can also log in as user:
1. by adding yourselt to a list through form
2. by using the account of some other company. Try for example:
	name: Herkku Gifts
	pwd:  herkbreh  (all passwords for companies in database are formed like this; 4 letters of name, 4 letters of address)

If you get stuck with logins/logouts, you can always return to main page through address row :)

Next, see the flaws in another document for more details.

Cheers,
Kaisa
