# cybersecuritybase-project

This is first course project for cyber security mooc course series (https://cybersecuritybase.github.io/), 
organised by University of Helsinki in collaboration with F-secure.

My aim within this project is to implement a very simple web application with at least five common, severe security flaws.
I'll then make a report of those flaws identified in the application and suppose ways to fix them.

This little java/spring project is forked from a course template https://github.com/cybersecuritybase/cybersecuritybase-project.
